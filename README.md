Role-based dashboards simulate how Payroll and IT teams may review these selections — using dummy data only.

🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project was developed during an internship to provide the organization with a ready-to-use frontend structure built using Classic ASP, in alignment with their existing technology dependency.

The objective was to:

Provide a clear UI foundation for future development

Help teams visualize workflows using an ASP-based architecture

Allow future backend integration without changing legacy systems

Serve as a reference frontend prototype for internal teams

This approach bridges modern UI expectations with continued reliance on ASP technology.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a frontend-only demo project.
All data used is mock/dummy data, and no real authentication, backend processing, or database connectivity is implemented.
